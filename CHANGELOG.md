# Changelog

All notable changes to PyroCade. Downloads are on the [releases page](https://github.com/Pyrodrifter/PyroCade/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **macOS**: a universal `.dmg` that runs natively on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs. The emulator downloader installs the official macOS builds of all 11 catalog emulators (RPCS3 natively on Apple Silicon), and **Use existing program…** accepts an app from the Applications folder. Forks and GitHub emulators get their macOS download and program guessed too.

### Changed
- Emulator buttons say "program" instead of ".exe", since Linux and macOS programs have no `.exe`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-11-05

### Added
- **LaunchBox Games Database** as the first artwork source, with no account needed. It provides full-size covers (often 1000–3000 px), back covers, screenshots, title screens and disc scans. Its game list (about 100 MB) is downloaded once and refreshed monthly.
- **Replace low-resolution covers with sharper copies** option in Artwork.
- Real cartridge labels for Game Boy, Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance, cropped from full cartridge photos. Real disc scans for PS1, PS2, GameCube and Dreamcast.
- Optional **ScreenScraper** artwork source, with an encrypted login under Artwork → Sources.
- **Emulator forks:** each emulator's **Source…** editor accepts a fork or any GitHub repository, optional dev builds and optional file patterns. **Check repo** previews what would be installed, and **Use official** switches back.
- **Add your own emulator** from a GitHub repository, with automatic downloads and updates. The download file and program are guessed when no pattern is given.
- Selectable **backgrounds**: XMB ribbon, Orbit, Constellation, Towers & orbs, Loom, animated pixel-art day/night/auto, or off.
- **Idle screensaver** with a large clock that drifts through your collection. The input that wakes it never launches a game.

### Changed
- Brand, page tabs, systems and search share **one slim top bar**. The selected tab and system are marked with a soft pill and an accent underline.
- Calmer library: shelf heading and badges hidden, arrows shown on hover, hints fade when idle, two-line descriptions, and the demo banner fades by itself.
- Plastic cases have a hinge groove, and generated spines take their colours from the cover.

### Fixed
- RPCS3 couldn't install, because its Windows download is now named `…_win64_msvc.7z`.
- WebP images with a `.jpg` name are now read correctly, and one unreadable image no longer hides the next candidate.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-11-05

### Added
- Systems can have several ROM folders, separated by `|` or added with **+ Add**. Missing folders, such as an unplugged SD card, are skipped.
- Switch 2 games get artwork from GameTDB.

### Changed
- Removed marketing-style taglines and decorative labels, and hid extra headings, hints and the input badge.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added
- **Linux packages:** AppImage, deb, rpm and pacman.
- Linux download rules (official AppImages) for all 11 catalog emulators.
- Self-update on Linux: the AppImage replaces itself, and distro packages show an update banner.
- Release workflow that builds Windows and Linux, smoke-tests the AppImage and .deb, and attaches everything to a draft release.

### Changed
- Emulator installs handle single-file AppImages, use the Linux extract tools and mark programs executable. Old versioned AppImages are cleaned up.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-04

### Added
- First release: a 3D carousel launcher with box art, manuals and disc/cartridge reveals, an emulator downloader and updater, artwork fetching, and controller button prompts.
- Windows installer, plus an update check on start that offers the new setup or source zip.
- PyroCade flame-play branding and app icon.

### Fixed
- Emulator links and custom emulators are protected from stale settings saves, and the linked `.exe` is kept apart from the catalog's file pattern.
- Launching finds the ROM by game ID, keeps `$` in paths, and only minimizes once the emulator has started.
- Settings are saved atomically, and a damaged settings file is backed up instead of overwritten.
